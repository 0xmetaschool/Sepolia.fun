# Sepolia.fun

Sepolia.fun is an advanced Web3 template for creating and deploying meme token systems. It utilizes bonding curve mechanics for price discovery and integrates automated Uniswap liquidity, enabling developers to establish sustainable token ecosystems with ease.

## Live Demo


## Features

- **Automated Price Discovery:** Bonding curve mechanism ensures fair and dynamic token pricing.
- **Uniswap Integration:** Automatically creates and locks liquidity pools upon reaching funding targets.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor funding progress and token distribution.
- **Sustainable Token Economics:** Implements bonding curve mathematics and automated liquidity locking.
- **User Analytics Dashboard:** Provides insights into token holders and transaction history.
- **Secure Smart Contracts:** Built with OpenZeppelin standards and Solidity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ethers.js
- **AMM Integration:** Uniswap V2
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin
- **Mathematics:** Bonding Curve for Automated Market Making (AMM)

## Use Cases

- **Automated Liquidity:** Establish liquidity pools for trading without manual intervention.
- **Decentralized Price Discovery:** Enable price adjustments based on token supply and demand.
- **Sustainable Economies:** Build ecosystems with locked liquidity and capped token supply.
- **Community-Driven Tokens:** Launch tokens with fair distribution mechanisms.

## How to Use

1. **Connect Web3 Wallet:** Use MetaMask to connect your wallet to the platform.
2. **Create Token:** Initiate token creation with a minimal fee of 0.0001 ETH.
3. **Distribute Initial Supply:** Release 200k tokens as the initial supply.
4. **Bonding Curve Purchases:** Tokens are bought through the bonding curve mechanism.
5. **Monitor Funding Progress:** Track the funding progress until the 24 ETH target is reached.
6. **Uniswap Pool Creation:** At 24 ETH, the platform automatically creates and locks a Uniswap liquidity pool.
7. **Trade on Uniswap:** Begin trading tokens directly on Uniswap.
